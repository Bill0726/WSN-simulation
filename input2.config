# Format for 'Events'
# <EventType> : <CauseOfEvent> : <AtTime>
# These are the significant events that are given by the user. These events internally generates
# there own events to perform their tasks.
# Example: 'SENSE_EVENT' event will generate internal events like- producing sensed data, forwarding
# it to CH, Data-aggregation by CH,	CH forward data to its next hop, so on.
# NOTE: Add a maximum upto 100 events for safely and properly running the simulation.
