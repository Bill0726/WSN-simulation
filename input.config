# Format for 'Events'
# <EventType> : <CauseOfEvent> : <AtTime>
# These are the significant events that are given by the user. These events internally generates there own events to perform their tasks.
# Example: 'SENSE_EVENT' event will generate internal events like- producing sensed data, forwarding it to CH, Data-aggregation by CH,
# 			CH forward data to its next hop, so on.

Events=
SENSE_EVENT:N3:1.0
# The above event means: The sensor node 3(i.e., 3rd sensor node) has sensed an event and now has to send information to the BS via its CH.
